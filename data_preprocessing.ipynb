    "# 🧩 Feature Extraction - description of each feature\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessing step converts each raw high-frequency cut file into a compact set of **10 physically meaningful features**.  \n",
    "The motivation is to summarize the rich sensor data (forces, vibrations, and acoustic emissions) into quantities that capture **tool load, stability, and degradation behavior**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Feature Overview and Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Force RMS Magnitude (`F_rms`)**\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "F_{rms} = \\sqrt{mean(F_x^2 + F_y^2 + F_z^2)}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "- Represents the overall mechanical load on the cutter.  \n",
    "- As the tool wears, cutting forces typically increase due to friction and reduced sharpness.  \n",
    "- A stable but rising `F_rms` trend is a strong indicator of progressive wear.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Vibration RMS Magnitude (`V_rms`)**\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "V_{rms} = \\sqrt{mean(V_x^2 + V_y^2 + V_z^2)}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "- Indicates the total vibrational energy of the spindle–workpiece system.  \n",
    "- Higher vibration levels correspond to chatter, imbalance, or worn-out cutting edges.  \n",
    "- Used widely in condition monitoring for early detection of tool instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Mean Force–Vibration Angle (`mean_angle`)**\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\vec{F}\\cdot\\vec{V}}{|\\vec{F}||\\vec{V}|}\\right)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "- Captures the average alignment between force and vibration vectors.  \n",
    "- When the cutting process is stable, these vectors are nearly aligned.  \n",
    "- Deviations (larger angles) signify irregular contact, misalignment, or chatter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Top-100 Angles Mean (`top100_angle`)**\n",
    "- The average of the **100 largest instantaneous angles** observed during a cut.  \n",
    "- Emphasizes rare but strong misalignment events, which often precede surface damage or catastrophic failure.  \n",
    "- Provides sensitivity to intermittent chatter bursts that a simple mean would miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Acoustic Emission Mean (`AE_mean`)**\n",
    "- Average amplitude of the AE-RMS signal.  \n",
    "- AE signals reflect micro-fractures, friction, and plastic deformation.  \n",
    "- As wear progresses, AE energy increases due to intensified material contact and micro-cracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Force Magnitude Variability (`F_std`)**\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "F_{std} = std(F_{net})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "- Measures the fluctuation of cutting force magnitude during a cut.  \n",
    "- Large variability indicates unstable chip formation or intermittent tool–workpiece engagement.  \n",
    "- High `F_std` correlates with degraded cutting efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Vibration Kurtosis (`V_kurt`)**\n",
    "- Statistical measure of “peakedness” of the vibration signal.  \n",
    "- Sensitive to shocks or impulsive behavior, which occur when the tool edge chips or breaks.  \n",
    "- High kurtosis is a classical indicator of mechanical impacts and faults.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Force–Vibration Correlation (`F_V_corr`)**\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "corr(F_{net}, V_{net})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "- Quantifies dynamic coupling between the applied load and the structural response.  \n",
    "- High correlation → predictable, stable process.  \n",
    "- Decreasing correlation → nonlinear chatter or random impacts due to wear.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Force Spectral Centroid (`F_spec_centroid`)**\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "C_f = \\frac{\\sum f_i \\cdot |FFT(F_{net})_i|}{\\sum |FFT(F_{net})_i|}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "- Represents the “center of mass” of the force signal spectrum.  \n",
    "- A shift toward higher frequencies indicates chatter and vibration excitation at the spindle natural modes.  \n",
    "- Effective for detecting transition from steady to unstable cutting regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. Acoustic Energy Ratio (`AE_energy_ratio`)**\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "R_{AE} = \\frac{E_{high}(10\\text{–}20\\,kHz)}{E_{low}(0\\text{–}10\\,kHz)}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "- Ratio of high-frequency to low-frequency AE energy components.  \n",
    "- As the cutter dulls, more high-frequency bursts appear due to micro-fractures and abrasive wear.  \n",
    "- Provides a frequency-domain indicator of tool health.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "These 10 features are chosen to collectively capture:\n",
    "- **Load behavior** → via force magnitude and variability  \n",
    "- **Dynamic response** → via vibration energy and kurtosis  \n",
    "- **Cross-interaction** → via angle and correlation measures  \n",
    "- **Spectral indicators** → via force centroid and AE ratio  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, they condense each high-bandwidth cut into a compact, interpretable vector suitable for **RUL regression and wear-stage classification** models.\n"
